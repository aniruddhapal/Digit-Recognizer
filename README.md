# Digit-Recognizer
This is a handwritten digit recognizer created using Artificial Neural Network which has been trained on more than 40000 handwritten digits.
The dataset has 40000 records and 784 columns.
Model is trained with train.csv and tested on test.csv.
sample_submission_1.csv is the submission file submitted to kagggle.
The neural network has 1 output layer, 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer with 10 nodes.
model has been compiled with adam optimizer and loss as sparse categorical crossentropy.
With 10 epoch it provided more than 96% accuracy.
